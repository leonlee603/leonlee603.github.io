          <h1>Why did I start programming?</h1><br>
          <p>As I pursued a bachelor degree in Physics, people might wonder why I would change my career 
            into programming after years of work. I used to have a misconception about coding, 
            which sounds like talking to computer with lots of boring syntax. I did not know I would 
            enjoy it so much until I actually approached coding. So it’s never too late to start doing 
            something ones like!</p>
          <p>I started with watching tutorials through online learning platform during my free time. 
            After working on some basic practices, all of my preconceptions about coding have been 
            completely wiped out. I found it extremely interesting and I was impressed by the possibilities 
            of how programming skills can be applied to anything in a wide range of fields.</p>
          <p>Why I love coding because it is really fun when I treat it like playing LEGO, it allows us 
            to have full control on building anything we can imagine with limitless ways of approach. 
            (as long as the codes are accurate, it runs!) Also, structuring a programme is an art, if 
            you consider making it concise, clean and fast at the same time.</p>
          <p>The constant phase of learning is another reason why I like programming. Exploring others’ 
            work always inspire me a lot, while sharing ideas with friends help me push my boundaries 
            and learn something new every day. Just like studying Physics, it may takes time and lots 
            of hard work to solve a problem. But still I am eager to figure out the possible solutions 
            and most importantly, the massive feeling of accomplishment when I get something right just 
            motivates me to keep trying and experimenting new techniques.</p>
          <p>Since I ever produced my first application using Python, I found that I am obsessed into 
            the world of programming. I have always enjoyed making things from scratch and been excited 
            to see people using things that I create. I expect myself to take it professionally by gaining 
            more on-job experiences and improving my skills in developing high quality softwares.</p>
